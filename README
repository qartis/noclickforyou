A simple x11 utility to make an x11 window invisible to mouse events. While
this program is active any mouse events over the target window will fall
through to the next window below it.

Hitting Ctrl-C will exit this program and undo the effects on the target
window.

Usage:
  ./noclickforyou <window-id>

If you want to click to select a target window, you can use a program such as
xdotool or slw from wmutils. For example:
  ./noclickforyou $(xdotool selectwindow)
